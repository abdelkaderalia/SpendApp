# SpendApp
This repository is a workspace for my final project for PPOL545 - Data Science II

For this project, I built an app using Streamlit that pulls data from the USASpending API to generate interactive visualizations of spending data for different government agencies based on the user's selections. [Watch a demo of the app here.](https://github.com/abdelkaderalia/SpendApp/raw/main/Deliverables/Abdelkader_Alia_Streamlit_Demo.mp4)
